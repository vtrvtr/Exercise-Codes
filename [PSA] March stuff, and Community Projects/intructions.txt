Hey folks - two quick updates.

## March and Team Members

If you haven't already spotted it, we've taken on two new members of the moderation team on the subreddit. From March onward, the right honourable /u/jnazario and the right noble /u/XenophonOfAthens will also be creating and submitting challenges to the subreddit (amongst other things, of course), alongside the usual staff members. A big welcome to them!

If you applied on the Hiring thread but weren't chosen, then don't lose any enthusiasm! We looked carefully at every application submitted, and those applicants will be the first place we look should we want to expand again in the future.

## Community Projects

We have quite a few community-maintained projects on sites like GitHub now, so it would be nice to keep track of them all! There is a list on our wiki which is [available here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/community) (and also through a link in the sidebar) where you can access it.

If you have your own project, submit it as a comment on this thread, we'll look at it, and we'll put it onto the list if it's looking cool! This thread will be used if you want to get your challenge on the list in the future, too (until it gets archived).

If you have any suggestions as to how we should organise the list of community projects (eg. how they should be categorised) then feel free to comment with those, too.

Ta-ta.
